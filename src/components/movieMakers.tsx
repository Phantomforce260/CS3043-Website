                <p className="bubble-text">Throughout the movie, Miguel painstakingly and ruthlessly emphasizes the need for order and uniformity, in order to prevent catastrophic events in the multiverse. It is very clear that Miguel is a very strict utilitarian - He decides on Miles’ behalf to detain him in Nueva York to prevent him from stopping the impending canon event in Miles’ universe. He argues that the cost of one life pales in comparison to the cost of destroying an entire universe. The movie writers arm him with technology such as the multiverse prediction algorithm in order to make his argument more convincing, and portray him as an all-knowing, unstoppable force.</p>
                <p className="bubble-text">However, the movie writers also paint a contrasting picture in Hobie Brown, a.k.a. “Spider-Punk.” Hobie is inherently a rebellious character who subtly acts against the wishes of O’Hara. In the words of Chris Miller, one of the writers of the film: “Spider-Punk was an obvious choice to be the counter to Miguel’s world view and to be someone who seems like an antagonist but is actually an ally.” [7] He refuses to abide by the establishment and is willing to forgo the strict utilitarian principles that rule Spider Society in order to enact what he perceives as right and just. [8] This is made evident in his “gift” to Gwen Stacy: A custom-made, prototype multiverse watch, almost certainly made without the knowledge or consent of O’Hara. Gwen is then able to use this watch to recruit her own band of spider-people to help rescue Miles.</p>

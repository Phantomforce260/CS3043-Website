                    <h2>Multiverse Collider</h2>
                    <p>The collider, created in the previous film and shown as the main plot driver due to its destructive capabilities, is shown as an attempt at travelling between universes. While the specific science is not elaborated on, it creates dark matter as a means to opening a path between universes. This is verging real, since there are particle colliders such as the CERN collider. What is real is very new in terms of testing, since the CERN collider opened in 2008 and is still being used to run experiments on atomic behavior.</p>

                    <h2>Multiverse Watch</h2>
                    <p>The watch is used to open gates and travel between different universes in the multiverse. It also acts as a stabilizer for people not in their original universe. The premise of a multiverse and traveling between them is a theoretical debate in the physics community, and the ability to open up gates and stabalizing people not in their intended universe is fictional. It has some smaller capabilities like acting as a communicator between multiverses and a way to access a main computer, referenced later in the film.</p>
                    <p>It is partially realistic given the duality of tasks it does in such a compact package. Modern smart watches are able to communicate like phones to an extent as well as connect to the internet. The primary purpose of the watch isn’t as realistic given the principle it is based on is a theoretical one.</p>
                    <p>The main course topics this falls under are Communication, Security, and Privacy and Government. Its primary purpose is to help the users travel through the multiverse to protect the safety of different universes and get rid of anomalies between universes. It helps the team of Spider people to protect regular citizens. This also creates a grey area in government structure formed by the spider people but not clearly shown as following any strict rules. The group of Spider people follow one main leader, Miguel O’Hara, and listen to his experience and use his technology as a guide on how to protect people throughout the multiverse. The watch is used as a tool to do so and help the different Spider people communicate, providing a massive asset to their operations.</p>

                    <h2>Surveillance Computers and Prediction Algorithm</h2>
                    <p>In the movie, Miguel has access to some kind of computer system that is able to survey and connect to camera or other technologies across many different universes. This system’s priority is keeping track of different universes to ensure that no anomalies or invaders from other universes cross to other worlds. The idea of a computer system able to connect across different timelines is complete fiction, but the use of computers to connect to cameras to survey is very present in our modern world, an example being security cameras which have a similar purpose to what this multiversal computer system is using in the move.</p>
                    <p>The system has an algorithm that can accurately predict/foreshadow events in the timelines of each spider-person's universe, shown in the movie that it is able to alert the heroes whenever a canon event, or a moment significant in the timeline for each spiderman, is about to occur. There are prediction algorithms that exist in real life, an example being weather forecasts.</p>
                    <p>This technology falls under the themes of communication, security, privacy, and government. The existence of this technology is helpful to Miguel and his team for tracking these multiversal threats, but there is never clarity on if this surveillance is allowed by the governments of each of these worlds. While the technology appears to be used for good intentions, there is a reasonable concern of a loss of privacy for the citizens of each world who have no idea this surveillance is ongoing. The technology's ability to connect across different multiverses to alert on when canon events is an example of its ability to function as a communication device.</p>
                    <p>Based on Miguel’s backstory, we know this computer must have existed before it was utilized for detecting anomalies, as Miguel used the system to find a universe where a Miguel had died so he could take his place. This had disastrous consequences, as Miguel altering with the timeline of the universe caused it to collapse. This raises the question of whether this system needs proper surveillance to make sure it is used properly, as it appears Miguel has little to no checks on power with the system and its functionality.</p>

                    <h2>DNA Analyzer</h2>
                    <p>In the movie, there is a large device that can scan the DNA of the spider-people to send them back to their respective universes, which utilized the scanning of the eye to help identify who it was. This played a pivotal role at the end of the story when Miles Morales was sent to the wrong universe, as the machine analyzed the spider that bit him which came from another dimension, sending him there instead of his own world.</p>
                    <p>Using eyes for identification is a practice that dates to the 1900s, and commercial products for eye recognition software were available in the 1990s. The connection between scanning the eye and how that translates to DNA is unclear, and that aspect is likely fictional.</p>
                    <p>The machine’s mistake in sending Miles to the wrong universe could fall under the topic of computer reliability. The machine’s purpose is to analyze DNA, and in that regard, it appears to have a focus on the spider DNA that is inside the spider-people when they are bitten. This system has a fundamental flaw: it only has one system to detect the correct universe for each person. With the ability of different people and things being able to cross through different universes like in the first movie (the radioactive spider that bit Miles was due to an experiment with Kingpin’s collider), it can be argued the DNA analyzer needs a greater number of features it analyzes to ensure it sends each person to the correct universe.</p>
